To impliment the CDB into the RS:

- Update the RS entries when operands become available though the CDB. 
- The CDB then broadcasts results from functional units to  reservation station, which then update their operands if they are waiting for those results. So send this data too. 


How we plan to broadcast Results: When a FU completes an operation, it should write the result, along with the tag of the operation, onto the CDB. (Need to do but later after RS)

Update Reservation Stations: On every clock cycle, check if the CDB carries a new result. If it does, compare the tag on the CDB with the tags (T1, T2) of operands in each reservation station entry. If there's a match, update the operand with the result from the CDB and mark it as ready.


CDB Packet:
//change name lol 
typedef struct packed {
    logic valid;
    TAG tag;
    logic [31:0] data; 
} CDB_PACKET;



boiler logic for the (Scratchpad)

if (CDB.valid) begin
            for (int i = 0; i < `RS_SZ; i++) begin
                if (rs_table[i].busy) begin
                    if (rs_table[i].T1 == CDB.tag) begin
                        rs_table[i].T1.ready = 1'b1;
                        // Assume you have a way to store the data too, if necessary
                    end
                    if (rs_table[i].T2 == CDB.tag) begin
                        rs_table[i].T2.ready = 1'b1;
                        // Assume you have a way to store the data too, if necessary
                    end
                end
            end
